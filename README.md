The Patient Registration System, developed using PHP, CSS, and JavaScript, is designed to store and manage patient records efficiently. It allows users to register new patient records by entering details such as name, contact number, address, and remarks, ensuring comprehensive documentation. The system displays all registered patients in a table for quick access and monitoring. Users can update existing patient information without creating new records, ensuring data accuracy, and can also delete patient records permanently to maintain an organized database. The search feature enables users to find specific patient records quickly by typing keywords like name or ID. To ensure safety and reliability, the system includes several security measures: input validation to prevent errors or malicious data, SQL injection protection using prepared statements or parameterized queries, access control to restrict modifications to authorized users only, data encryption to protect sensitive information, and regular backups to prevent data loss. Overall, this system simplifies patient record management, making it easier for healthcare providers to track, update, and secure patient information while ensuring data privacy and security.# Patient-Registration-System
